        "Since I was a child I have been into IT. It all started with disassembling old pc's or simply installing random linux os'es. In secondary school I chose to start studying Electricity and Electronics. This is were I got in touch with programming for the first time, I was so good at it that I got myself a LEGO Mindstorms robot too. In the fifth grade I switched to a secondary school in Geel, because they had Electronics with ICT. This is where I started programming for real. We learned c++, python with a Raspberry PI and embedded C. This is also when I started gaming and hosting my own Minecraft servers at home. The final project I did here was digitalizing an old pinball machine, I used a Raspberry PI connected to a relay board to read the scores from the machine and display them on a website.",
        "After I graduated I went to UHasselt to study IT, I learned a lot here and worked with real clients on big software projects using Vue, Typescript and Node.js.",
        "It was soon clear that I am more a practical type of person, so I made a switch to PXL with a specialization in systems and networking. I started getting in touch with IaC, DevOps, Cloud and so much more interesting stuff... For a project for Datasense, a Belgian company, I worked as a systems and DevOps engingeer. I implemented CI/CD pipelines on Microsoft Azure with lots of tools on a Kubernetes cluster.",
        "Probably the greatest thing in my career was my internship. Trough PXL I got the opportunity to travel to South Africa, where I successfully finished my internship as a DevOps engineer at Botlhale Village.",
        "What happened to my old Minecraft server? Well, I'm glad you asked. It is still running! It got a lot of upgrades and evolved into my so called 'homelab'. What was a simple Minecraft server before is now a Proxmox virtualisation server running a bunch of LXC containers and virtual machines. I am running my own file server, VPN, proxy, game server (using Pterodactyl, an open-source project for hosting all the game server you can imagine), Plex Media Server and lots more!"
